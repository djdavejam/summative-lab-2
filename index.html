        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>David James is a junior developer with a background in claim adjudication. His passion for technology stems back to his time at Stony Brook University in which he is now a proud alumni. He is also very big on philanthropy as he was once the President of the Community Service Club and partakes in many food drives as well as clothing drives. Giving back to the less fortunate is very important to him and helps keep him grounded.</p>
